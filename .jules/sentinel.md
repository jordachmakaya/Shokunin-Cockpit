## 2025-05-14 - Redacting Credentials in CLI Scripts

**Vulnerability:** Potential leakage of Git credentials (tokens/passwords) in error messages when parsing repository remotes.
**Learning:** CLI scripts that execute `git remote get-url` may capture sensitive strings. If these scripts fail and log the raw output to stdout/stderr, credentials can be leaked to CI logs or terminal history.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize Git remote URLs using regex (e.g., `url.replace(/:[^@/]+@/, ':***@')`) before including them in error messages or logs.
